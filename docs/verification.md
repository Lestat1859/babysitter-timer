# Verification

This section covers testing and validation procedures for the Babysitter Timer application.

## Testing Strategy

The Babysitter Timer application employs several testing approaches to ensure quality and reliability:

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify that individual components and functions work as expected in isolation.

```typescript
// Example unit test for date utility functions
describe('dates utility', () => {
  test('formatDate should format date correctly', () => {
    const date = new Date(2023, 0, 15); // January 15, 2023
    expect(formatDate(date)).toBe('15/01/2023');
  });
  
  test('calculateDuration should return correct duration in hours', () => {
    const startDate = new Date(2023, 0, 15, 18, 0); // 6:00 PM
    const endDate = new Date(2023, 0, 15, 22, 30);  // 10:30 PM
    expect(calculateDuration(startDate, endDate)).toBe(4.5);
  });
});
```

### Component Testing

Component tests verify that React components render correctly and respond appropriately to user interactions.

```typescript
// Example component test for BabySittingElement
describe('BabySittingElement', () => {
  test('renders babysitting details correctly', () => {
    const babysitting = {
      id: '123',
      startDate: new Date(2023, 0, 15, 18, 0),
      endDate: new Date(2023, 0, 15, 22, 30),
      price: 45
    };
    
    render(<BabySittingElement babysitting={babysitting} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('15/01/2023')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('4.5 hours')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('€45')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

```typescript
// Example integration test for authentication and data access
describe('Authentication and data access', () => {
  test('authenticated user can access babysitting data', async () => {
    // Mock authentication
    mockAuthenticatedUser();
    
    // Render component that requires authentication
    render(<Babysitting />);
    
    // Verify data is loaded
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Your Babysitting Sessions')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Add New Session')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, running tests automatically on each push and pull request.

```yaml
# Example CI workflow
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## Pre-deployment Verification

Before deploying to production, verify the following:

1. All tests pass
2. Manual testing checklist is completed
3. Code has been reviewed
4. Performance metrics are acceptable
5. Security checks have been performed
